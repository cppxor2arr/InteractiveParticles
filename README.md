# Interactive Particles

Interact with particles with the mouse. The interaction modes are attraction (**Z**), repulsion (**X**), and swirl (**C**).

The parameters are simulation speed, number of particles, particle size, interaction force, drag, and trail length. They can be changed interactively.

You can watch a demonstration video below.
